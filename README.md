# Rules for contributing
- Your contribution must not break any rule of the Paper Mario Modding server.
- Your contribution may not overwrite the work of another person without express permission of the original person.
- Your contribution must be able to compile, and not unavoidably crash the game.
- Your contribution must keep the game in a somewhat vanilla structure. new maps are okay, but they must be functionally the same as the map they are replacing.
